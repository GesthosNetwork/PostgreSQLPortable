     Logical decoding is the process of extracting all persistent changes
     to a database's tables into a coherent, easy to understand format which
     can be interpreted without detailed knowledge of the database's internal
     state.
    </p><p>
     In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, logical decoding is implemented
     by decoding the contents of the <a class="link" href="wal.html" title="Chapter 30. Reliability and the Write-Ahead Log">write-ahead
     log</a>, which describe changes on a storage level, into an
     application-specific form such as a stream of tuples or SQL statements.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" id="LOGICALDECODING-REPLICATION-SLOTS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">49.2.2. Replication Slots <a href="#LOGICALDECODING-REPLICATION-SLOTS" class="id_link">#</a></h3></div></div></div><a id="id-1.8.14.8.3.2" class="indexterm"></a><p>
     In the context of logical replication, a slot represents a stream of
     changes that can be replayed to a client in the order they were made on
     the origin server. Each slot streams a sequence of changes from a single
     database.
    </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> also has streaming replication slots
     (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION" title="27.2.5. Streaming Replication">Section 27.2.5</a>), but they are used somewhat
     differently there.
     </p></div><p>
     A replication slot has an identifier that is unique across all databases
     in a <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> cluster. Slots persist
     independently of the connection using them and are crash-safe.
    </p><p>
     A logical slot will emit each change just once in normal operation.
     The current position of each slot is persisted only at checkpoint, so in
     the case of a crash the slot may return to an earlier LSN, which will
     then cause recent changes to be sent again when the server restarts.
     Logical decoding clients are responsible for avoiding ill effects from
     handling the same message more than once.  Clients may wish to record
     the last LSN they saw when decoding and skip over any repeated data or
     (when using the replication protocol) request that decoding start from
     that LSN rather than letting the server determine the start point.
     The Replication Progress Tracking feature is designed for this purpose,
     refer to <a class="link" href="replication-origins.html" title="Chapter 50. Replication Progress Tracking">replication origins</a>.
    </p><p>
     Multiple independent slots may exist for a single database. Each slot has
     its own state, allowing different consumers to receive changes from
     different points in the database change stream. For most applications, a
     separate slot will be required for each consumer.
    </p><p>
     A logical replication slot knows nothing about the state of the
     receiver(s).  It's even possible to have multiple different receivers using
     the same slot at different times; they'll just get the changes following
     on from when the last receiver stopped consuming them. Only one receiver
     may consume changes from a slot at any given time.
    </p><p>
     A logical replication slot can also be created on a hot standby. To prevent
     <code class="command">VACUUM</code> from removing required rows from the system
     catalogs, <code class="varname">hot_standby_feedback</code> should be set on the
     standby. In spite of that, if any required rows get removed, the slot gets
     invalidated. It's highly recommended to use a physical slot between the
     primary and the standby. Otherwise, <code class="varname">hot_standby_feedback</code>
     will work but only while the connection is alive (for example a node
     restart would break it). Then, the primary may delete system catalog rows
     that could be needed by the logical decoding on the standby (as it does
     not know about the catalog_xmin on the standby). Existing logical slots
     on standby also get invalidated if <code class="varname">wal_level</code> on the
     primary is reduced to less than <code class="literal">logical</code>.
     This is done as soon as the standby detects such a change in the WAL stream.
     It means that, for walsenders which are lagging (if any), some WAL records up
     to the <code class="varname">wal_level</code> parameter change on the primary won't be
     decoded.
    </p><p>
     Creation of a logical slot requires information about all the currently
     running transactions. On the primary, this information is available
     directly, but on a standby, this information has to be obtained from
     primary. Thus, slot creation may need to wait for some activity to happen
     on the primary. If the primary is idle, creating a logical slot on
     standby may take noticeable time. This can be sped up by calling the
     <code class="function">pg_log_standby_snapshot</code> function on the primary.
    </p><div class="caution"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3><p>
      Replication slots persist across crashes and know nothing about the state
      of their consumer(s). They will prevent removal of required resources
      even when there is no connection using them. This consumes storage
      because neither required WAL nor required rows from the system catalogs
      can be removed by <code class="command">VACUUM</code> as long as they are required by a replication
      slot.  In extreme cases this could cause the database to shut down to prevent
      transaction ID wraparound (see <a class="xref" href="routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND" title="25.1.5. Preventing Transaction ID Wraparound Failures">Section 25.1.5</a>).
      So if a slot is no longer required it should be dropped.
     </p></div></div><div class="sect2" id="LOGICALDECODING-EXPLANATION-OUTPUT-PLUGINS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">49.2.3. Output Plugins <a href="#LOGICALDECODING-EXPLANATION-OUTPUT-PLUGINS" class="id_link">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
     Output plugins transform the data from the write-ahead log's internal
     representation into the format the consumer of a replication slot desires.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" id="LOGICALDECODING-EXPLANATION-EXPORTED-SNAPSHOTS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">49.2.4. Exported Snapshots <a href="#LOGICALDECODING-EXPLANATION-EXPORTED-SNAPSHOTS" class="id_link">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
     When a new replication slot is created using the streaming replication
     interface (see <a class="xref" href="protocol-replication.html#PROTOCOL-REPLICATION-CREATE-REPLICATION-SLOT">CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT</a>), a
     snapshot is exported
     (see <a class="xref" href="functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-SNAPSHOT-SYNCHRONIZATION" title="9.27.5. Snapshot Synchronization Functions">Section 9.27.5</a>), which will show
     exactly the state of the database after which all changes will be
     included in the change stream. This can be used to create a new replica by
     using <a class="link" href="sql-set-transaction.html" title="SET TRANSACTION"><code class="literal">SET TRANSACTION
     SNAPSHOT</code></a> to read the state of the database at the moment
     the slot was created. This transaction can then be used to dump the
     database's state at that point in time, which afterwards can be updated
     using the slot's contents without losing any changes.
    </p><p>
     Creation of a snapshot is not always possible.  In particular, it will
     fail when connected to a hot standby.  Applications that do not require
     snapshot export may suppress it with the <code class="literal">NOEXPORT_SNAPSHOT</code>
     option.
