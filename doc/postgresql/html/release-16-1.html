      Detect integer overflow while computing new array dimensions
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      When assigning new elements to array subscripts that are outside the
      current array bounds, an undetected integer overflow could occur in
      edge cases.  Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable for
      arbitrary code execution are possible, and so is disclosure of

      Prevent the <code class="literal">pg_signal_backend</code> role from
      signalling background workers and autovacuum processes
      (Noah Misch, Jelte Fennema-Nio)
     </p><p>
      The documentation says that <code class="literal">pg_signal_backend</code>
      cannot issue signals to superuser-owned processes.  It was able to
      signal these background processes, though, because they advertise a
      role OID of zero.  Treat that as indicating superuser ownership.
      The security implications of cancelling one of these process types
      are fairly small so far as the core code goes (we'll just start
      another one), but extensions might add background workers that are
      more vulnerable.
     </p><p>
      Also ensure that the <code class="varname">is_superuser</code> parameter is
      set correctly in such processes.  No specific security consequences
      are known for that oversight, but it might be significant for some
      extensions.

      Fix misbehavior during recursive page split in GiST index build
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>
      Fix a case where the location of a page downlink was incorrectly
      tracked, and introduce some logic to allow recovering from such
      situations rather than silently doing the wrong thing.  This error

      It may be advisable to reindex all GiST indexes after installing

      Prevent de-duplication of btree index entries
      for <code class="type">interval</code> columns (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>
      There are <code class="type">interval</code> values that are distinguishable but
      compare equal, for example <code class="literal">24:00:00</code>
      and <code class="literal">1 day</code>.  This breaks assumptions made by btree
      de-duplication, so <code class="type">interval</code> columns need to be excluded
      from de-duplication.  This oversight can cause incorrect results
      from index-only scans.  Moreover, after
      updating <span class="application">amcheck</span> will report an error for
      almost all such indexes.  Users should reindex any btree indexes
      on <code class="type">interval</code> columns.

      Process <code class="type">date</code> values more sanely in
      BRIN <code class="literal">datetime_minmax_multi_ops</code> indexes
      (Tomas Vondra)
     </p><p>
      The distance calculation for dates was backward, causing poor
      decisions about which entries to merge.  The index still produces
      correct results, but is much less efficient than it should be.
      Reindexing BRIN <code class="literal">minmax_multi</code> indexes
      on <code class="type">date</code> columns is advisable.

      (Tomas Vondra)
     </p><p>
      Infinities were mistakenly treated as having distance zero rather
      than a large distance from other values, causing poor decisions
      about which entries to merge.  Also, finite-but-very-large values
      (near the endpoints of the representable timestamp range) could
      result in internal overflows, again causing poor decisions.  The
      index still produces correct results, but is much less efficient
      than it should be.  Reindexing BRIN <code class="literal">minmax_multi</code>
      indexes on <code class="type">timestamp</code> and <code class="type">timestamptz</code>
      columns is advisable if the column contains, or has contained,
      infinities or large finite values.

      Fix inconsistent rechecking of concurrently-updated rows
      during <code class="command">MERGE</code> (Dean Rasheed)
     </p><p>
      In <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> mode, an update that finds that
      its target row was just updated by a concurrent transaction will
      recheck the query's <code class="literal">WHERE</code> conditions on the
      updated row.  <code class="command">MERGE</code> failed to ensure that the
      proper rows of other joined tables were used during this recheck,
      possibly resulting in incorrect decisions about whether the
      newly-updated row should be updated again
      by <code class="command">MERGE</code>.

      Correctly identify the target table in an

      even when the parent table is excluded by constraints (Amit Langote,
      Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If the initially-named table is excluded by constraints, but not all
      its inheritance descendants are, the first non-excluded descendant
      was identified as the primary target table.  This would lead to
      firing statement-level triggers associated with that table, rather
      than the initially-named table as should happen.  In v16, the same
      oversight could also lead to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">invalid perminfoindex 0 in RTE

      exactly to the end of the matches for a ScalarArrayOpExpr (that is,

      Suppress assorted build-time warnings on

     </p><p>
      <span class="productname">Xcode 15</span> (released
      with <span class="productname">macOS Sonoma</span>) changed the linker's
      behavior in a way that causes many duplicate-library warnings while
      building <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.  These were
      harmless, but they're annoying so avoid citing the same libraries
      twice.  Also remove use of the <code class="option">-multiply_defined
      suppress</code> linker switch, which apparently has been a no-op
      for a long time, and is now actively complained of.

      Remove <code class="literal">PHOT</code> (Phoenix Islands Time) from the
      default timezone abbreviations list (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Presence of this abbreviation in the default list can cause failures
      on recent Debian and Ubuntu releases, as they no longer install the
      underlying tzdb entry by default.  Since this is a made-up
      abbreviation for a zone with a total human population of about two
      dozen, it seems unlikely that anyone will miss it.  If someone does,
      they can put it back via a custom abbreviations file.
